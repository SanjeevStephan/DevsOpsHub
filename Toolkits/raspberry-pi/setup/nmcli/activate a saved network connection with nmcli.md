To activate a saved network connection using `nmcli`, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection up <connection-name>
```

### Steps to Activate a Connection

1. **Identify the Connection Name**: First, you need to know the exact name of the connection you wish to activate. You can list all saved connections with:

   ```bash
   nmcli connection show
   ```

2. **Activate the Connection**: Once you have the connection name, replace `<connection-name>` in the command above with the actual name. For example, if your connection is named "MyOfficeConnection", you would run:

   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection up MyOfficeConnection
   ```

3. **Verify Activation**: To confirm that the connection has been successfully activated, you can check the list of active connections with:

   ```bash
   nmcli connection show --active
   ```

This command will display all currently active connections, allowing you to verify that your desired connection is now active.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of activating a saved Ethernet connection named "Wired connection 1":

```bash
# List all saved connections
nmcli connection show

# Activate the desired connection
sudo nmcli connection up 'Wired connection 1'

# Verify activation
nmcli connection show --active
```

Using these commands, you can easily manage and activate your network connections through `nmcli`.
