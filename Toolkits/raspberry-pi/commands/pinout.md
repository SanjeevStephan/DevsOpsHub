## Overview of Raspberry Pi GPIO Pinout

The Raspberry Pi features a 40-pin GPIO header that allows users to connect various peripherals and components. The pins can serve multiple functions, including general-purpose input/output (GPIO), power supply, and communication protocols like I2C, SPI, and UART.

### Pin Numbering Schemes

1. **Physical Pin Numbering**: Refers to the physical layout of the pins on the header.
2. **Broadcom (BCM) Numbering**: Refers to the specific GPIO numbers assigned by the Broadcom chip used in the Raspberry Pi.

### Key Functions of GPIO Pins

- **Power Pins**: Provide 3.3V and 5V power to connected devices.
- **Ground Pins**: Common ground reference for circuits.
- **GPIO Pins**: Configurable pins that can be set as input or output.
- **I2C Pins**: Used for I2C communication (SDA and SCL).
- **SPI Pins**: Used for SPI communication (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, CE).
- **UART Pins**: Used for serial communication (TXD and RXD).

### Example Pinout Table

Here’s a simplified version of the pinout for the Raspberry Pi:

| Pin Number | BCM Number | Function          |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1          | -          | 3.3V              |
| 2          | -          | 5V                |
| 3          | 2          | SDA (I2C)         |
| 4          | -          | 5V                |
| 5          | 3          | SCL (I2C)         |
| 6          | -          | GND                |
| 7          | 4          | GPIO4             |
| 8          | 14         | TXD (UART)        |
| 9          | -          | GND                |
| 10         | 15         | RXD (UART)        |
| ...        | ...        | ...               |
| 39         | -          | GND                |
| 40         | 21         | GPIO21            |

The `pinout` command on the Raspberry Pi is a utility provided by the `gpiozero` library that allows users to easily query and display the GPIO pinout information for their specific Raspberry Pi model. Here's how to use it effectively:

### Overview of the `pinout` Command

- **Basic Usage**: Running the command `pinout` in the terminal will output a detailed diagram of the GPIO header, along with information about the Raspberry Pi model, its revision, and available features.
  
- **Command Syntax**:
  ```bash
  pinout [-h] [-r REVISION] [-c] [-m] [-x]
  ```

### Options

- **-h, --help**: Displays help information about the command.
- **-r REVISION, --revision REVISION**: Allows you to specify a particular Raspberry Pi board revision code. If omitted, it will autodetect the current device's revision.
- **-c, --color**: Forces colored output in supported terminals.
- **-m, --monochrome**: Forces monochrome output.
- **-x, --xyz**: Opens the output in your default web browser.

### Example Usage

1. **Display Current Board Information**:
   Simply run:
   ```bash
   pinout
   ```
   This will show a diagram similar to this for a Raspberry Pi 3B:
   ```
   Description : Raspberry Pi 3B rev 1.2
   Revision : a02082
   SoC : BCM2837
   RAM : 1GB
   Storage : MicroSD
   USB ports : 4 (of which 0 USB3)
   Ethernet ports : 1 (100Mbps max. speed)
   Wi-fi : True
   Bluetooth : True
   Camera ports (CSI) : 1
   Display ports (DSI): 1
   ```

2. **Specify a Revision**:
   If you want to query a specific revision, use:
   ```bash
   pinout -r 000d
   ```
   
3. **Force Monochrome Output**:
   To get a non-colored output (useful for redirection), run:
   ```bash
   pinout --monochrome
   ```

### Installation

If you do not have the `gpiozero` library installed, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
```

### Conclusion

The `pinout` command is an invaluable tool for anyone working with Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, providing quick access to pin configurations and capabilities. It simplifies the process of connecting hardware components by clearly displaying which pins are available and their functions.
