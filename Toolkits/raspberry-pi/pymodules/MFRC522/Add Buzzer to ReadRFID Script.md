To enhance the previous RFID reading script with a buzzer that confirms when a card is successfully read, you can modify the Python code accordingly. Below is the updated script that includes a buzzer functionality along with displaying the card information.

### Required Components

1. **Buzzer**: A simple piezo buzzer.
2. **Wiring**: Connect the buzzer to one of the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. For example:
   - Connect one terminal of the buzzer to GPIO pin 18 (or any other GPIO pin).
   - Connect the other terminal to Ground.

### Updated Python Script

Hereâ€™s the modified script that incorporates the buzzer:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from mfrc522 import SimpleMFRC522
import time

# Setup GPIO for buzzer
buzzer_pin = 18  # Change this to your chosen GPIO pin
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(buzzer_pin, GPIO.OUT)

reader = SimpleMFRC522()

def buzz():
    """Function to sound the buzzer."""
    GPIO.output(buzzer_pin, GPIO.HIGH)  # Turn on buzzer
    time.sleep(0.5)                      # Buzzer on for 0.5 seconds
    GPIO.output(buzzer_pin, GPIO.LOW)   # Turn off buzzer

try:
    print("Hold a tag near the reader...")
    while True:
        id, text = reader.read()
        print("ID: %s\nText: %s" % (id, text))
        buzz()  # Sound the buzzer upon successful read
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for a second before reading again

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Program terminated.")
finally:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Buzzer Setup**: The script initializes a GPIO pin for the buzzer. The `buzzer_pin` variable is set to 18, but you can change it according to your wiring.
- **Buzz Function**: A function named `buzz()` is defined to turn on the buzzer for 0.5 seconds and then turn it off.
- **Buzzer Activation**: The `buzz()` function is called immediately after successfully reading an RFID tag, providing audible feedback.

### Running the Script

1. Save this code in a file named `ReadWithBuzzer.py`.
2. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ReadWithBuzzer.py
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 ReadWithBuzzer.py
   ```

When you place an RFID tag near the reader, you should hear a beep from the buzzer confirming that the tag has been successfully read, and you will see the ID and text information displayed in the terminal.

### Note

Make sure to install any necessary libraries if you haven't done so already, and ensure that your Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins are correctly configured and connected according to your setup.
