To display text in a stylized way using **FIGlet** fonts in Python, you can use the `pyfiglet` library. This library allows you to create ASCII art from text using various FIGlet fonts. Here’s how to set it up and use it:

## Step 1: Install `pyfiglet`

You can install the `pyfiglet` library using `pip`. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```

## Step 2: Using `pyfiglet` to Display Text

Once you have installed the library, you can use it in your Python scripts. Here’s a simple example of how to display text using `pyfiglet`:

```python
import pyfiglet

# Create a FIGlet font object
font = pyfiglet.Figlet(font='slant')  # You can choose other fonts as well

# Generate ASCII art from text
ascii_art = font.renderText('Hello, World!')

# Print the ASCII art
print(ascii_art)
```

### Example Output

When you run the above code, it will output something like this (the actual appearance may vary based on the chosen font):

```
     __          __         _   _       _       _ 
     \ \        / /        | | | |     | |     | |
      \ \  /\  / /__  _ __ | |_| | ___ | |_ ___| |
       \ \/  \/ / _ \| '_ \| __| |/ _ \| __/ _ \ |
        \  /\  / (_) | | | | |_| | (_) | ||  __/_|
         \/  \/ \___/|_| |_|\__|_|\___/ \__\___(_)
```

## Step 3: List Available Fonts

If you want to see what fonts are available with `pyfiglet`, you can list them using the following code:

```python
import pyfiglet

# List all available fonts
fonts = pyfiglet.FigletFont.getFonts()
print(fonts)
```

This will print a list of all available FIGlet fonts that you can use.

## Conclusion

Using the `pyfiglet` library, you can easily create and display stylized text in your Python applications. This can be particularly useful for creating eye-catching console output or for generating ASCII art representations of messages.
